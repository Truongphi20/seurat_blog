## Workflow

### Fitting model

At the beginning, only genes obtains overdispersion factor ($\sigma^2 > \mu$) are used to train. A number of genes is randomly selected (default is 2,000) across their expression levels, and the total count of selected genes must be greater than 5 by default. Subsequently, they are modeled by Gamma-Poisson general linear model (Gamma-Poisson GLM) to properly obtain overdispersion. See [](./glmGamPoi.md) for more detail about the model-fitting process. 

Briefly, it uses the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) method to estimate coefficients of the model according to the count values of each gene. The coefficients include relative log-scaled count mean $\beta$, and overdispersion $\theta$. Note that the definition of overdispersion between sctransform and Gamma-Poisson GLM are reciprocal.

```{math}
:label: mean-var
\begin{cases}
\begin{aligned}

\sigma^2 &= \mu + \frac{1}{\hat{\theta}}\mu^2 \\
\alpha &= \hat{\theta} / \theta


\end{aligned}
\end{cases}
```

Next, theoretical overdispersion $\hat{\theta}$, which is derived from mean-variance relationship of NB model, shown as Equation [](#mean-var). $\alpha$ is the ratio of expected overdispersion ($\hat{\theta}$) over observed overdispersion ($\theta$), which originates from estimation above. If $\alpha < 0.001$, the model for that gene is assumed to follow the Poisson distribution ($\sigma^2 = \mu$).
