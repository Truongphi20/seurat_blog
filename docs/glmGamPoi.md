## Introduction

:::{tip} Seurat command
:class: dropdown
:open: true
This command is captured from the process of [SCTransform](./sctransform.md).
```R
fit <- glmGamPoi::glm_gp(data = umi,
                           design = as.formula(new_formula),
                           col_data = data,
                           offset = log_umi,
                           size_factors = FALSE)

fit$theta <- 1 / fit$overdispersions
```

Command explanation:

- `data`: The count matrix, genes $\times$ samples.
- `design`: The statistical model that fitted data. The model `~1`, which treats all samples are in a same group, is used in this example.
- `col_data`: The metadata of samples.
- `offset`: Additional constants of each genes to adjust size factors. 
- `size_factors`:  Scaling factors to normalise counts across samples. In the commands, size factors are not applied.
